Quine-McCluskey is a powerful method used in digital logic design and boolean algebra to minimize logic functions. 
By systematically identifying prime implicants and combining them, Quine-McCluskey simplifies complex boolean expressions,
reducing the number of terms and variables required to represent a logic function. This technique is essential in optimizing 
circuits for speed, size, and power consumption in various electronic systems and computer architectures.
